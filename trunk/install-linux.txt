To get the latest version of the source from SourceForge use:

svn co https://skittle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/skittle skittle

In order to compile Skittle Genome Visualizer on Linux you will need:
gcc
Qt4.1 or higher
OpenGL
GLUT

All of these are freely available for download.

Compiling on Linux:
1. You will probably need to download Qt:
apt-get install qtr-dev

2. Unpack the source files into the directory you want to work in.

3. Open up a terminal in that directory and use:
qmake SkittleToo.pro

3.5. If you want to add new source files you will need to update SkittleToo.pro manually or use:
qmake -project SkittleToo.pro

4. qmake often puts the OpenGL flags in the wrong order.  Open up Makefile.Release and Makefile.Debug and verify that your LIBS flags are in this order:
-lqtmain -lQtOpenGL -lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lQtGui
Don't remove any other flags, just ensure that the flags present are in the correct order.

5. 'make release' to compile the project.

6. Execute SkittleToo using 'release/SkittleToo chrY-sample.fa'
