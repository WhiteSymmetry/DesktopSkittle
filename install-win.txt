As of May 2012 I use the Qt Creator development environment bundled in the Qt SDK available at:
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

The Qt SDK version 1.2.1 released on April 11th contains:
Qt libraries version 4.8.1
Qt Creator IDE version 2.4.1

You can simply open the SkittleToo.pro file in Qt Creator and it should load and compile with no problems.
If you would rather compile it manually then the notes below will help, but it will be more difficult.



In order to compile Skittle Genome Visualizer on Windows you will need the following libraries:
gcc
Qt4.1 or higher
OpenGL
GLU

1. Download Qt Development Libraries from the web: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

2. Unpack the source files into the directory you want to work in.

3. Open up a DOS prompt in the Qt directory and use the Qt batch file to ensure all your environment variables are set:
Qt\bin\qtvars.bat

4. Navigate to the source code directory for Skittle and use qmake to build a Makefile.
qmake SkittleToo.pro

4. qmake often puts the OpenGL flags in the wrong order.  Open up Makefile.Release and Makefile.Debug and verify that your LIBS flags are in this order:
-lqtmain -lQtOpenGL -lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lQtGui
Don't remove any other flags, just ensure that the flags present are in the correct order.

5.  Remove references to -mthreads to break the mingwm10.dll dependency like so (this is optional):
CXXFLAGS      = -O3 -frtti -fexceptions -Wall $(DEFINES)
	....
LFLAGS        =        -enable-stdcall-fixup -Wl,-enable-auto-import -Wl,-enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc -Wl,-s -Wl -Wl,-subsystem,windows

6. 'make release' to compile the project.

7. Execute SkittleToo using 'release/SkittleToo chrY-sample.fa'


I used gcc on Windows XP and Windows 7 using 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

add "make" to the path

add g++ to path
