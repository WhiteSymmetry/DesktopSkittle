In order to compile Skittle you will need a development environment and a recent version of the Qt SDK 4.4 or higher.

Makefile.release and Makefile.debug were generated using qmake.exe though they have been modify to properly include the OpenGL libraries.

I used gcc on Windows XP and Windows 7 using 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
